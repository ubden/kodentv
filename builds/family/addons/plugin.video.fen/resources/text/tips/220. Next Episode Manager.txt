[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Next Episode Manager[/B][/COLOR]
[I]In Fen there is a manager for Next Episodes where you can change settings related to the display/organization of the Next Episodes. Further more, there is a 'Manage In Progress Shows' which will allow you to hide/unhide shows from the Next Episode display. If using Trakt for your watched history, this is easier than going to the Trakt website to hide/unhide shows from progress. These settings can be accessed from Tools->Next Episode Manager, or from the context menu when in the Next Epsiodes section. Try it out to see...[/I]
