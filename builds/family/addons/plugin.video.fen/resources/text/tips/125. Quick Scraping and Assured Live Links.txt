[COLOR dodgerblue][B]Quick Scraping and Assured Live Links[/B][/COLOR]
[I]If you have a debrid account set up in Fen, you can cut down your search times significantly by turning on cached torrents only, and only enabling torrent scrapers in Openscraper settings. Typically, searches with these settings take well under 20 seconds, and you are assured of only seeing links which are definitely available to stream (i.e. no dead links). If you subscribe to Furk or Easynews, turn those scrapers on too in Fen's settings for the ultimate experience in high quality, fast results. Try it out to see...[/I]
